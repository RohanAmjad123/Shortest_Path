# Shortest_Path

A Graph class that implements Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
Edge data is parsed from test.txt and the shortest path is calculated from: 
- YYC to YYZ
- YYC to YUL
- YYC to YVR

Output format: {cost hops shortest_path}

This Graph class is implemented to represent how traceroute calculates the hops and RTT between two different IP addresses.
